# SleevePose
SleevePose is a wearable system for continuous 3D hand pose estimation using an elastic pressure sensing sleeve. It captures forearm surface deformations via a 13×9 resistive textile matrix and predicts MANO hand mesh parameters through a ResNet+Transformer pipeline. The dataset includes 720k synchronized pressure and RGB frames from 18 users.
